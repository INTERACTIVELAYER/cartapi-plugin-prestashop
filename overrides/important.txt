This plugin is divided into 2 areas:

1. Plugin Overrides - located in PRESTASHOP/modules/appixiacartapi/overrides
2. Core Plugin - all other content of PRESTASHOP/modules/appixiacartapi

All of your changes and customizations should only be in the Plugin Overrides (much like how core Prestashop works with customizations).

If you make changes in the core plugin, you will not be able to upgrade it.

The plugin was designed with overrides in mind, so all behavior you want to change should be easily available for change through Plugin Overrides.



The Plugin Overrides (everything in PRESTASHOP/modules/appixiacartapi/overrides) include some default examples. Feel free to change those around. All content in the overrides folder is under your responsibility.
